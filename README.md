QuadroAmps can be used on a breadboard for prototyping new circuits,
or it can mounted into a 1U Rack system using one of the 1U x 16 HP front panel designs.

QuadroAmps can be used in combination with two (2) or more other ERA modules
for mounting in a 3U ERA or Eurorack format card or even larger rack format


**thingSoC Reference Designs** are example thingSoC implementations that implement
various reference and testing circuits for demonstrating the use of the thingSoC libraries.
These reference designs can serve as starting templates for user designs.
